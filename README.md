## Usage
Follow these steps to use the Video Player for GitHub and upload your own video:

1. Download the Code: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.<br>
2. To clone the repository, open your terminal (or command prompt) and run: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git<br>
3. Upload Your Video: Place your video file in the repository's folder. For example, if your video file is named my_video.mp4, put it in the same folder as the index.html file.<br>
4. Update Video Source: Open the index.html file using a text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, Notepad++).<br>
5. Modify the Video Source: Find the <video> element in the HTML code: <video src="path/to/your/video.mp4" class="video" playsinline></video> <br>
6. Replace "path/to/your/video.mp4" with the relative path to your video file. For example, if your video file is in the same folder as index.html, you can use: <video src="path/to/your/video.mp4" class="video" playsinline></video> <br>
7. If your video file is in a subfolder, adjust the path accordingly.<br>
8. Save the Changes: Save the index.html file after making the necessary modification.<br>
9. Open the Video Player: Navigate to the repository's folder and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. You can do this by either double-clicking the index.html file or dragging it into your browser.
10. Play Your Video: Once the page loads in your browser, the video player will automatically start playing your uploaded video. Use the controls provided by the player to adjust volume, playback speed, and switch to full-screen mode.<br>
11. That's it! You have now successfully replaced the video source with your own video and can use the Video Player for GitHub to showcase your content.<br>
12. Commit and push your changes to the repository.<br>
14. Visit your GitHub repository on any web browser to see the embedded video player in action.<br>
